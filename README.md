# PowerShellHere

This repo contains a PowerShell script for adding a "PowerShell Here" entry to the right click context menu in Windows Explorer.

This branch contains a copy of the script that isn't as fancy and is only a series of built-in PowerShell calls. It is useful for systems where only signed scripts can be run.
